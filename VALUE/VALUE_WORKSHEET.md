	* Own answers.

6. Can you notice a difference between items that have low supply vs items that have high supply?
	* Students should be able to determine a link between supply volume and value.

7. How does a limited supply of new items make it scarce?
	* Expect students to struggle on this, but should be able to explain that something hard to manufacture, find, create, is generally more expensive than that which is not.

8. What would happen to the price of DIAMONDS if someone found 1 / 100000000000 diamonds in their back yard and sold them?
	* 1 would not change anything.
	* 100000000000 would over supply the demand, and lower the value of diamonds.

	* Diamonds, made naturally over 100's of years.
	* Works of art, done by specific artist.
