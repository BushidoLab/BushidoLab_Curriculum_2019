### Value Demonstration

Show the kids something cheap (cheap hat, paper, note books). Now show the kids something valuable (nice hat, phone, computer).

Make an offer to trade them both at the same price. Ask the kids which they would rather choose and have them explain why.

All the kids (hopefully) are going to chose the expensive item first. Allow them to explain why they chose that one.

Answers you want to hear are:
- It's more VALUABLE.
- I can get one of the cheap items very easily (high supply).
- I dont want the cheap item (low demand).
- I can't get one of the expensive items easily (low supply).
- The cheaper item is being over priced by the teacher (intrinsic / derived value, with some inflation).
