# Lesson Plan Template

Grade Level: 4th - 5th grade.

Subject: VALUE.

Length of time: 

## Objectives & Outcomes

The outcome of this lesson is to teach the students the meaning of VALUE, as well as the following topics:
- Scarcity
- Supply/Demand
- Intrinsic/Derived Value

## Materials Needed

Standard stationary, pencil and paper.

The following worksheets:
- [VALUE_WORKSHEET](VALUE_WORKSHEET.md)
- [VALUE_DEMONSTRATION](VALUE_DEMONSTRATION.md)

## Procedure

Begin the lesson with some theoretical coverage of the above mentioned topics.

Afterwards, using the [VALUE_WORKSHEET](VALUE_WORKSHEET.md) begin a question dialogue with the students. 

End the lesson with a demonstration by the teacher, referring to the [VALUE_DEMONSTRATION](VALUE_DEMONSTRATION.md) document.

### Opening to lesson

Begin with theory. [Attached](VALUE_WORKSHEET.md) is an in-detail coverage of:
- Value
- Scarcity
- Supply/Demand
- Intrinsic/Derived Value

### Body of lesson

This section of the lesson can be done in groups or individually called out. I'd recommend groups and have the students discuss the question and report an answer.

[Attached](VALUE_WORKSHEET.md) is a list of questions that can be asked to groups. Students are graded based on their answers.

### Closing

End the lesson with a [practical demonstration](VALUE_DEMONSTRATION.md). Attached is a description of the exercise. The exercise is simply a display of two different items of contrasting value. 

One item being something very cheap, easy to get hold of, low demand, high supply. 

The other item should be something intrinsically valuable, hard to get hold of, high demand, low/mid supply.

Show the items to the students have them guess the value of each item. Once they've decided their value, offer to trade both items for the SAME price. Ask which item the students would chose and have them explain why.

## Assessment & Evaluation

Students are assessed on their participation, and the thought put into their answers.
