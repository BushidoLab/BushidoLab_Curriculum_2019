# Trading Demonstration

Trading is the simple transfer of one item of value, for another.

If I have a shiny rock, that you happen to like, this rock now has "value". If you want to take this rock from me, you need to give me something in return.
This is known as an 'exchange of value' between two 'peers'.

### Practical example:

Separate the class in two groups,

One half of the class gets a 'shiny rock' (or what ever) the other half of the class gets some coins (or something else).

The class is then tasked to go and make an exchange. They must find someone to trade with and when they find that person, they must initiate the trade and receive their requested items. 

To complete the trade, both the traders must go to the white board and write down that they transferred x to y and y to x.

This way, 'Jimmy' can now prove that he traded his rock for 2 coins from 'Tommy'. 

### Demonstration.

Teacher splits the class into two groups. 

Group 1: Receives an object, this object is considered 'valuable'. Explain to the kids, that there are only X of them in the whole world! They are very special and once they are destroyed, they're gone for ever!

Group 2: Receives 'money'. 

Teacher then tells the kids to walk around, and trade freely with each other. 

It is important that when a trade is made, the kids go to the board and write down their transaction. 

At the end of the exercise. Ask 'Jimmy' where did he get those rocks? Jimmy should be able to view his transaction on the board. If he cant, then have him explain why.
