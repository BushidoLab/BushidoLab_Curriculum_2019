# Trading Info

### TRADING & BARTERING:

What is trading?

* Trading is the transfer of goods between 2 or more people. Usually done with items of value.

How was trading done in the old days?

* Trading used to be done face to face. People would discuss and come to an agreement of what the value of their items was, and exchanged goods accordingly.
* Trading used to be done with any and all items. Trades between farmers such as 1 cow for 500 tomatoes. Trades between people such as one knitted hat for a pair of shoes.

What is bartering?

* A barter is an exchange of goods of equal value, usually done without money, but with physical goods/services.

**Questions for kids:**

* What do you have that you are willing to trade?
* What would you trade that item for \(someone in the room\)?

Now that we understand value, and know what trading is. Now we need to come up with a way to record who traded what, when and for how much. This can be done with what is called a "LEDGER".

## 2.PHYSICAL LEDGER

What is a ledger? A ledger is a list of transactions that have been made between two parties. A ledger records the items that were traded, who was involved in the trade, and when the trade took place. The ledger serves as a reference for people who want to check up on who traded what.

![Modern ledger](http://www.leoisaac.com/fin/images/ledger_page.gif)

If one day I see Billy riding his new bike, and Sandy playing with her XBOX. And then the next day I see Sandy on Billy's bike, and Billy ruining Sandy's playing on Billy's XBOX, I'm going to say:

> 'HEY! How did Billy get that XBOX?'

If I want to check, I can go to the ledger and see:

```text
-------------T-O-W-N--L-E-D-G-E-R-------------
----------------------------------------------
Trade between Billy and Sandy @ 1 January 2019
----------------------------------------------
Billy's Item: Bike

Sandy's Item: XBOX
----------------------------------------------
Billy traded his item 1 for 1 with Sandy.
Sandy traded her item 1 for 1 with Billy.
----------------------------------------------
Billy lost bike, gained XBOX.

Sandy Lost XBOX, gained Bike.
----------------------------------------------
Signed.........BILLY ✓
Signed.........SANDY ✓
-------------T-O-W-N--L-E-D-G-E-R-------------
```

What are the important parts of this record?

* The time and date of the transaction.
  * People can now check each day for transactions.
  * People can refer back to the ledger to see when they made a certain trade.
* The names of both parties that traded.
  * People can now check who was trading.
  * People can now see who traded with who.
* The items both parties put up to trade.
  * People can now see what items were traded.
* The record stating X lost Y, gained Z.
  * People now know who owns what.
* The final signatures.
  * Confirmation from both parties.
  * People can now see that BILLY AGREED to trade with SANDY.
  * People can now see that SANDY AGREED to trade with BILLY.

**Questions for Kids:**

* Why is it important that both Billy and Sandy can see the ledger?
  * So that they can prove a trade was made, and refer back to the items/time/signatures if needed.
* Why is it important to have a record of who traded what?
  * It is important as a means of verification and proof of purchase/trade.
* Why is it important that the date's are recorded?
  * Can't cheat the system to trade an item twice, or trick the system.
* Why is it important that both traders sign the ledger at the end?
  * To show that both parties agreed to the trade and finished the trade successfully.
* If Billy didn't sign the transaction, what would happen to Sandy's XBOX? What would happen to Billy's Bike?
  * Billy's transaction would be 'invalid' or 'incomplete'. He would not rightfully own the XBOX, because Sandy clearly didn't agree....

### OWNERSHIP OF VALUE & RECORD KEEPING

What is OWNERSHIP?

* Ownership is the legal right of possession.
* Owning something means it belongs to YOU, and you are free to trade it or not. 

What is RECORD KEEPING?

* Record keeping is simply keeping a history of peoples activities. These activities can be trades.
* Record keeping is important because it allows us to VERIFY activities.

Thanks to this ledger, we now have a system in place that can record and prove peoples ownership. If someone questions where I got X item from, I can simply refer to the ledger and VERIFY that I purchased/traded/swapped something to receive this item.

In this way, we no longer have to TRUST people when they say they bought it from Jimmy or Sandy, we can VERIFY OURSELVES that they made the trade on 1 January 2019.

**Questions for Kids:**

* Why is it important to know who OWNS what?
  * So you cant steal and use other peoples possessions. 
* Can you explain the difference between VERIFY and TRUST?
  * Trust means to believe what you are told.
  * Verify means you check it for yourself.
* Why do you want to VERIFY something rather than TRUST someone?
  * Because there are bad people who would lie to benefit the system. Verifying ensures no one can do this.
* What important things would need a LEDGER to keep track of?
  * Student Performances \(stars for kids\)
  * Diary / Calendar \(history of events\)
  * Personal Spending
* Can you think of a problem with there being only 1 ledger?
  * If it is lost, all the information is gone.
  * If its manipulated, there is no way to verify.

### SHORTCOMINGS

![ANCIENT LEDGER](https://recordkeepingroundtable.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/wpef7.jpg)

What are the negative sides of having a physical ledger?

* People who want to trade need to physically write on the ledger. And be present during signing.
* If the ledger is damaged, or lost, and is the only one, then everyone's transaction history is lost and no one knows who OWNS what.
* Physical ledgers are out dated.
* It is easy to forge and put incorrect information either on purpose or by accident.

## 2.DIGITAL LEDGER

Now that we understand what a PHYSICAL LEDGER is, let's introduce a DIGITAL LEDGER.

A DIGITAL LEDGER is the same thing as a physical ledger, only, it's DIGITAL. It's on computers and on the internet.

Imagine Billy and Sandy want to trade again. Remember the example how they were able to go face to face and trade? What if Billy moved and was on the other side of the world!

How would they be able to trade items? They would need to meet in person, complete their trade and record it on the ledger. This seems like a lot of work, if Billy and Sally just want to trade Stamps. Now in 2019 we live in a digital age and things aren't being recorded in physical form anymore. This is where digital ledgers come in:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Trade between Billy and Sandy @ 5 February 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------
Billy's Item: $5.00

Sandy's Item: RARE Baseball Card
----------------------------------------------------------------
Billy traded his item 1 for 1 with Sandy.
Sandy traded her item 1 for 1 with Billy.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Billy lost $5.00, gained RARE Baseball Card.

Sandy Lost RARE Baseball Cards, gained $5.00.

**Questions for Kids:**

* How could having only 1 centralized ledger be a problem?
  * It could be lost or tampered with.
* Can you think of a way we could have more than one ledger but everyone keep the same information?
  * Multiple copies of the ledger shared amongst many people.

### DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL LEDGER

Great! Now Billy and Sandy have traded items. Billy got the baseball card he wanted and Sandy got paid $5.00 for it!

What if Sandy wants to spend that 5 dollars? She's seen that her friend Maria from Mexico wants to trade her hat for $5. Sandy can send her $5 she has and buy the hat from her. But how does Maria know that Sandy really has that money? Well, she'd have to look at the ledger between her and Billy!

There's just one problem, she only has a ledger of trades between her and Sandy, not between Sandy and Billy! This means, Maria has no way of trusting Sandy that the $5 she actually has is really hers. How can we fix this problem?

We can solve this problem by having a **DISTRIBUTED LEDGER**, which is a shared electronic copy of everyone's ledger on the internet. Now Maria can check the ledger and look back and see, Sandy traded her Rare Baseball Card for the $5.00. Now they can complete their trade and record it on the ledger like this:

**Questions for Kids:**

* Why is it important that Maria knows about Sandy's trade between her and Billy?
* If Maria now wants to trade with someone else, will she record it on the ledger? 
* This is called a chain of transactions, can you think of another word for chain?

With the growth in technology, and the access to the internet, some very smart people were able to figure out a way to ensure EVERYONE is able to have a ledger, update it and view it themselves without having to go to a bank or trust that the banks were in control of their money. Basically, with this software, you can be your **OWN** bank!

### CONCLUSION

What is a BLOCKCHAIN?

* A blockchain is a software application, similar to an app on your phone.
* All the computers that are running this software application are all CONNECTED to each other on the internet. 
* When I want to add something to the ledger, I make a transaction. Then the software automatically tells as many people as it can that you want to make this addition to the ledger.
* Each of these computers will check if the person owns the items they are trying to trade.
  * If they do, the transaction is VALIDATED and then passed on again to more computers who do the same thing.
  * If the user does not own the items they are trying to trade, the transaction is considered INVALID. The computers then stop passing this information because they know it is wrong.
* Once everyone knows about it, the transaction is considered VALIDATED.
* VALIDATED transactions are then added to a BLOCK, and are continuously confirmed by computers that check and check and check the list of transactions.

**Questions for Kids:**

* What happens if I try to spend / trade something I dont have?
* What happens when my trade transaction is VALIDATED?

## DISTRIBUTED VS CENTRALIZED LEDGER

![DISTRIBUTED/CENTRALIZED LEDGER](https://137938-400316-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blockchain-vs-distributed-ledger.png)

In this image you can see:

* All the banks on the left are sending information to a CLEARING HOUSE who will add the transactions and information to the ONE CENTRALIZED ledger.
* On the left side, there is only one ledger.
* On the right, you can see that each bank has its own ledger, every time they add something to it, they share the information to everyone and they update theirs the same way.

Questions for kids:

* Which of these scenarios above seems like the safer option?
* What problems could come up from having only 1 ledger?
* Why is it easier to validate a transaction on a distributed ledger?
