# Lesson Plan Template

Grade Level: 4th - 5th grade.

Subject: TRADING.

Length of time: 

## Objectives & Outcomes

At the end of the lesson, the students should understand the following key words:
- exchange
- peers
- value
- transfer
- scarcity

Students must understand how trades are done peer to peer. Students need to trade at least one time with another student so they can record their transaction.

## Materials Needed

The following worksheets:
- [WORKSHEET](TRADING_WORKSHEET.md)
- [DEMONSTRATION](TRADING_DEMONSTRATION.md)

During the exercise, each student needs either an 'item of value' or 'money to purchase an item'.

These items are not defined yet. The item of value needs to be divisible, so maybe a lego cube made out of 10 pieces or something.

## Procedure

The lesson begins with theoretical coverage of:
- exchange
- peers
- value
- transfer
- scarcity

Followed by a [worksheet](TRADING_WORKSHEET.md). 

Followed by a [role playing game](TRADING_DEMONSTRATION.md).

Ending with discussion.

### Opening to lesson

Begin with some theoretical coverage of the above mentioned topics. Go into some detail and test the students understanding of the keywords. Once the students have a grasp of the concepts, divide the class into two groups. 

### Body of lesson

Once the students have been exposed to the theoretical terms as well as the technical jargon, pass around a worksheet (attached). This worksheet should cover some of the topics from the lesson before (VALUE). This worksheet will be some opinionated questions. The questions can then either be reviewed right there or graded by the teacher later. 

Next exercise will be a role play. Half of the students will get a divisible item of value. And the other half will receive some form of currency to purchase. Students must then initiate trades around the room. Students can set their own prices, they are encouraged to price their items fairly, but are reminded that it is not mandatory, however, if they want to sell anything, they need to make it affordable. 

After each trade is made, students are required to go with their trade partner and record the trade on the ledger on the board.

### Closing

After all students have made a transaction. Have them sit down in their original seats. Begin discussion.

Discussion should cover several topics:
- How was value assigned?
- Was the trade you made fair? If not, who benefited?
- Why did you have to record your transaction?

Ask the students to point out their transaction's on the ledger.

## Assessment & Evaluation

Assess student answers to the worksheet and ensure they have a firm grasp of the concepts and keywords. Assess the students ability to describe the process that goes into a TRADE/EXCHANGE of GOODS.

Students are evaluated on their grasp of the core concepts. Students participation is required and are evaluated on that.
