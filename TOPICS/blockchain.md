# Teaching Blockchain:

What is blockchain?

EXACTLY that! a CHAIN of BLOCKS!

- lists of records are stored in "BLOCKS" of data.
- these BLOCKS link together and form a "CHAIN"

this creates a BLOCK-CHAIN

*Remember* you can only add BLOCKS to the BLOCKCHAIN, you can not REMOVE or EDIT them

Blocks, are: 

- A list of all transactions.
- Those transactions are added together to create one long 'string'
