# Mining Worksheet

In this exercise, we try to replicate bitcoins proof of work system in the simplest way possible.

Below is an example of what could be handed to the students during the the exercise.

## ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE PAGE

In this exercise you will be required to do several math problems. Please follow these steps or your "PROOF OF WORK" would be considered invalid, and you will have to start again!

Here's the steps:

1. Answer all 5 problems.
2. Take all the answer's you got and write them down somewhere.
3. ADD together all the answers, it will give you the "STARTING NUMBER"
4. Once you have the sum of all the answers, look back at the question to find the "FINAL NUMBER"
5. Figure out how much more you need to add to your "STARTING NUMBER" number to get the "FINAL NUMBER". This number is called the "MAGIC NUMBER"
6. Show your teacher:
   * The calculations you made with the first 5 questions and the STARTING NUMBER.
   * The calculation you made with the answers.
   * The MAGIC number.

The first one to present their newly mined block is the winner, and their block is added to the chain. Everyone then gets a new paper.

### GO!!

```text
FINAL NUMBER: 111

1. 4+8=
2. 2*9=
3. 10/5=
4. 80-72=
5. 12*3=

(show your calculations!)

STARTING NUMBER = 

(show your calculations!)

MAGIC NUMBER =
```

## EXPECTED RESULT:

The student answers the questions and has the answers:

### GO!!

```text
FINAL NUMBER: 111

1. 4+8=12
2. 2*9=18
3. 10/5=2
4. 80-72=8
5. 12*3=36

(show your calculations!)

12+18+2+8+36 = 76

STARTING NUMBER = 76

(show your calculations!)

111-76 = 35

MAGIC NUMBER = 35
```
