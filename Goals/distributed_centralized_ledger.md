![DISTRIBUTED/CENTRALIZED LEDGER](https://137938-400316-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blockchain-vs-distributed-ledger.png)

In this image you can see:
- All the banks on the left are sending information to a CLEARING HOUSE who will add the transactions and information to the ONE CENTRALIZED ledger.
- On the left side, there is only one ledger.
- On the right, you can see that each bank has its own ledger, every time they add something to it, they share the information to everyone and they update theirs the same way.

Questions for kids:
- Which of these scenarios above seems like the safer option?
- What problems could come up from having only 1 ledger?
- Why is it easier to validate a transaction on a distributed ledger?

# 3. INTRODUCTION OF CURRENCY

Why was currency introduced?
- Banks had a hard time transferring ownership of valuable assets.
- To avoid having to carry large amounts of gold/silver they developed a currency.
- The currency is supposed to resemble the total value held by a person in their bank.
